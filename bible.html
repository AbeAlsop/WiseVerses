        <h2>Top 20 Bible stories not read at Mass</h2>
        <p>If you have attended Mass all your life, and read the daily readings, then you have heard most of the Bible. However, there are still plenty of interesting passages that you may not have heard. Reading the whole Bible cover-to-cover would be a large investment of time; it would be nice if you could prioritize the best of those lesser-known chapters.</p>
        <p>Below are the top 20 passages not in the lectionary. These are almost all from the Old Testament, because the vast majority of the New Testament is already covered at Mass. Some of them fill in the missing details from a story that may already be familiar. But be warned: many are not appropriate for children.</p>
